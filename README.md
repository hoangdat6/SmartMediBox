# SmartMediBox - IoT Smart Medicine Cabinet ðŸ’Š

An IoT-enabled smart medicine cabinet built with ESP8266 and a React Native mobile application, designed to help users maintain medication adherence and proper medicine storage conditions.

## Project Overview

SmartMediBox addresses the critical challenge of medication adherence by providing an automated, connected medicine cabinet with a companion mobile application. The system ensures patients take the right medication at the right time, monitors storage conditions, and provides real-time updates through Firebase.

## Key Features

- **Automated Medication Reminders** - Audio and visual alerts when it's time to take medicine
- **Smart Compartment System** - Automatic opening of the correct medicine compartment at scheduled times
- **Environmental Monitoring** - Temperature and humidity monitoring with active humidity control
- **Mobile Application** - Remote monitoring and control via React Native app
- **Real-time Synchronization** - Firebase integration for real-time data and notifications
- **Medication History** - Track and analyze medication adherence patterns
